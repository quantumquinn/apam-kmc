A python package for predicting the kinetics of precursor adsorption on the silicon (100) surface using DFT barriers calculated in https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c08919. This package has been developed largely for the purpose of atomic precision doping purposes but can be adapted for any silicon (100) surface of interest.

Currently the only supported precursor molecule is diborane, but this package will be updated as future papers come online.

Python2 and KMClib are required prerequisites.

Information on KMClib can be found here: https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib
